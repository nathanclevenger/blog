# Programming with URLs

What if you could code in your browser?  I don't mean in the browser window, but actually in the address bar.

What if you could type `eval.do/1+1` into your browser and you saw:

```json
{
  "eval": "1+1",
  "result": 2
}
```

And you wouldn't even have to type it yourself, because the web is built on links like: <https://eval.do/1+1>.  Anyone could simply click on that link, and see results.
